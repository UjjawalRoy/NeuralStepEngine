Building a Neural Network from Scratch - Step by Step

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into a series of Python scripts, each representing a new step in the development of a neural network, using numpy for mathematical computations:

- `00_raw_neural_network.py`: A basic, raw neural network.
- `01_forward_prop.py`: Introduction to forward propagation.
- `02_batch_forward_prop.py`: Adding batch processing to forward propagation.
- `03_multilayer_forward_prop.py`: Expanding to multilayer neural networks.
- `04_multilayer_object_forward_prop.py`: Object-oriented design for multilayer neural networks.

Each script builds on the previous one, showcasing a progressive approach to constructing neural networks from scratch. The project relies on numpy for efficient array operations and mathematical computations.

## Inspired By
