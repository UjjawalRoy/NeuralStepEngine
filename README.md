# NeuralStepEngine
Building a Neural Network from Scratch - Step by Step

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into a series of Python scripts, each representing a new step in the development of a neural network, using numpy for mathematical computations:

- `00_raw_neural_network.py`: A basic, raw neural network.
- `01_forward_prop.py`: Introduction to forward propagation.
- `02_batch_forward_prop.py`: Adding batch processing to forward propagation.
- `03_multilayer_forward_prop.py`: Expanding to multilayer neural networks.
- `04_multilayer_object_forward_prop.py`: Object-oriented design for multilayer neural networks.
- `05_activation_functions.py`: Commonly used activation functions in neural networks.
- `06_softmax_raw.py`: Softmax function implementation using raw python.
- `07_softmax_numpy.py`: Softmax function implementation using Numpy.
- `08_softmax_numpy_batch.py`: Adding batch processing to softmax.
- `09_multilayer_object_forward_prop_update_1.py`: Multilayer feed forward network with activation functions.

Each script builds on the previous one, showcasing a progressive approach to constructing neural networks from scratch. The project relies on numpy for efficient array operations and mathematical computations.
